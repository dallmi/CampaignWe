## Goals 2026

### Client Focus

1. **Elevate stakeholder self-service through strategic analytics POCs** — Deliver 3–4 high-impact proof-of-concept solutions (e.g., Search, Campaign, Click Analytics) that unlock new self-service insights for Internal Communications, validate emerging data sources, and establish the blueprint for scalable, production-ready analytics capabilities.
   *Outcome: 3–4 POCs delivered and presented to stakeholders, with at least 2 progressed toward production-readiness.*

2. **Establish a proactive insights cadence** — Implement a structured reporting rhythm (monthly/quarterly) that delivers actionable engagement trends and strategic recommendations to Communications leadership — positioning analytics as a forward-looking strategic partner rather than a reactive data provider.
   *Outcome: Recurring reporting cycle established and consistently delivered throughout 2026, with positive stakeholder feedback on relevance and actionability.*

### Job Specific

1. **Deliver a cross-platform semantic layer for unique visitor tracking** — Design and implement a unified aggregation layer in Databricks that enables consistent, deduplicated audience measurement across all internal comms platforms — turning fragmented data into a single source of truth.
   *Outcome: Semantic layer operational and integrated into at least one production dashboard, enabling reliable cross-platform unique visitor reporting.*

2. **Advance video analytics maturity** — Build an enriched engagement model that transforms granular user-level events into composite metrics (effective watch time, engagement scores, drop-off patterns), enabling content quality assessment beyond simple view counts.
   *Outcome: Enriched video engagement model live and surfacing composite metrics in stakeholder-facing reports.*

3. **Pioneer Intranet Click Analytics** — Design and deliver the first-ever click analytics capability for the UBS intranet, providing Communications stakeholders with unprecedented visibility into user navigation behavior, content interaction patterns, and engagement hotspots — laying the foundation for data-driven content optimization.
   *Outcome: Click analytics POC delivered and validated with stakeholders, demonstrating actionable insights on intranet user behavior.*

### People / Team

1. **Drive data literacy across the function** — Deliver at least 2 knowledge-sharing sessions to upskill Communications stakeholders on interpreting and leveraging analytics outputs for decision-making.
   *Outcome: Minimum 2 sessions delivered with documented attendance and positive participant feedback.*

2. **Strengthen cross-functional partnerships** — Partner with Internal Digital Channels & Delivery and/or Communications Analytics & Insights on joint initiatives such as aligning tracking standards or co-developing shared data assets.
   *Outcome: At least one joint initiative completed or materially progressed, with tangible shared deliverable.*
